LECTURE 110: USING REFS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> React has a way to select a specific JSX element: the ref attribute
    -> Inside the value, a function is passed, which can be an anonymous arrow function
        -> Inside the argument, a reference to the element to be selected is placed 
        -> Inside the function body, the selected element is then stored in a global variable
    -> Within the 'componentDidMount' function body, a method is then applied to the global variable

-> There is a second way of using refs, used in React 13.6 and up:
    -> Create a constructor
        -> Pass props as an argument to that constructor
        -> Inside the constructor body, call the super component and again pass props to it
        -> Create a reference using 'React.createRef()' and store it inside a global variable
    -> Inside the component's ref attributem, pass the global variable (using the 'this'keyword) as the value
    -> The preferred method can again be applied within 'componentDidMount', using 'this.variable.current.method' 

-> Both methods can only be used inside class-bases components

-> An example of both methods can be found inside the 'Person.js' file
