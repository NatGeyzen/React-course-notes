LECTURE 86: A BETTER PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Persons.js:
    -> Created a new const, named 'persons' and assigned it an arrow function
    -> 'props' is passed as a parameter inside the arrow function
    -> If the function body only consist of a return statement, the {} and the return keyword can be ommited and replaced by just ()
    -> Imported react at the top of the file
    -> Copied the Person JSX code from 'App.js' file and pasted inside the return statement
        -> Changed 'this.state.persons.map' to 'props.persons.map'
    -> Imported Person from Person folder so 'Person' component can be returned
    -> Replaced any 'this' keywords in the file with 'props' 
    -> Replaced event handler names with 'clicked' and 'changed' instead of 'deletePersonHandler' and 'nameChangedHandler' respectively
    -> Exported component as default persons

-> App.js:
    -> Changed import for 'Person' to 'Persons' with respective relative path
    -> Deleted the JSX code that renders the list of persons if button is clicked (was copied into 'Persons.js' file)
    -> Created a new Persons component inside the div (self-closing tag)
    -> Gave the new component 3 attributes that were used as props inside 'Persons.js': persons, clicked, changed

-> Cockpit.js
    -> Copied h1 and p tags/text from inside 'App.js' return statement 
    -> Created a new cockpit component using an arrow function (with {} code block this time)
    -> Pasted the code from 'App.js' inside the function 
    -> Imported react and exported component, as always
    -> Wrapped copied code inside wrapper div
    -> Cut 'assignedClasses' code from 'App.js' and pasted inside cockpit function body, above return
    -> Like in 'Persons.js', any 'this' keywords are replaced by 'props'

-> Created new file inside 'Cockpit' folder: Cockpit.module.css
    -> Copied any codes except for '.App' rules from 'App.module.css' and pasted inside new file
    -> added '.Cockpit' in front of any '.Button' classes containing '.Button'

-> Cockpit.js
    -> Imported the css style rules into 'Cockpit.js' file using 'import classes' syntax
    -> Gave div wrapper className={classes.Cockpit}
    -> Removed btnClass variable from 'App.js' and pasted inside file with empty string as value
    -> Added if statement to check if persons are showing, with code to add 'Red' to classes inside body function
    -> Replaced 'nameChangedHandler' with 'clicked'

-> App.js
    -> Added new 'Cockpit' component inside return statement (previously where h1 and p tags were)
    -> Added 3 attributes to new component: showPersons, persons and clicked
