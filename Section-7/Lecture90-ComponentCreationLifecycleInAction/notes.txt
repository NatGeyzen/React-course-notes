LECTURE 90: COMPONENT CREATION LIFECYCLE IN ACTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Changes to App.js:
    -> Added constructor to the class component
        -> passed props as a parameter
        -> called 'super(props)' within function body
        -> NOTE: state can be  initialized within the constructor with 'this.state'
        -> '[App.js] constructor' is logged to console

    -> underneath the state, getDerivedStateFromProps was added
        -> this is a STATIC method!
        -> '[App.js] getDerivedStateFromProps' and props is logged to console
    
    -> inside the render() function, '[App.js] render' is logged to the console

    -> componentDidMount() was added and '[App.js] componentDidMount' is logged to the console

-> Changes to Persons.js:
    -> '[Persons.js] rendering ...' is logged to the console inside the person function
    -> the () in the function body are replaced with {} since there is now more code than just the return statement
    -> the return keyword is added in front of the return statement

-> Changes to Person.js:
    -> '[Person.js] rendering ...' is logged to the console inside the person function
