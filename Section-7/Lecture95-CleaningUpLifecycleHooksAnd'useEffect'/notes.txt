LECTURE 95: CLEANING UP WITH LIFECYCLE HOOKS AND 'useEffect()' 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> 'componentWillUnmount()' can be used for any clean up work, code that runs right before component is removed

-> method and console log added to 'Persons.js' file
    -> console log appears when toggling the persons to make them dissappear

-> 'useEffect()' can also be used

-> return state with console log added inside 'Cockpit.js' useEffect() method
    -> NOTE: does not currently work since the cockpit is never actually removed
    -> changes made to 'App.js' to show useEffect() clean up:
        -> button added right above Cockpit component
        -> new property 'showCockpit' added to state and set to true
        -> onClick event added to new 'Remove cockpit button'
        -> hardcoded anonymous fuction that sets 'showCockpit' to false
        -> Cockpit component wrapped inside ternatory operator 

-> useEffect() will only run cleanup work when component gets destroyed if an empty array is passed to it as a 2nd argument
-> if there is no 2nd argument, it will perform cleanup work every re-render
